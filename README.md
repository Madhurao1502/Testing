I have verified the update and clone functionality locally using User ID: X (promotor). Based on my testing, the user is able to successfully update and clone the sample. I used Sample ID: 7070 with the sample name "test", and the functionality is working as expected.

The only possible scenario where the user might be encountering an error is if they are trying to create a new sample with the same name, expecting it to overwrite the existing one instead of switching to edit mode.

Could you please confirm how the user is attempting to update the sample? This will help us ensure whether they are following the correct workflow.

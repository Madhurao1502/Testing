Subject: Deployment Update: New Changes Deployed to Production (ClientApp Web Application)

Hi [Manager's Name],

The following changes have been deployed to the ClientApp web application in production:

1. Time Period

A dropdown with three options has been added: 13 weeks, 26 weeks, and 52 weeks.

The Start Week is auto-populated and cannot be edited.

The End Week is auto-populated based on the selected Source Delivery and is editable.

2. Archived MDM Validation

When a user selects a Source Delivery where the associated MDM is archived, and clicks on the Process Item Attribute button,
we have added a validation to display a toaster message informing the user that:
"The selected MDM is archived and must be unarchived before proceeding."

3. Location-Based Condition Validation

When a user selects the "Location Based" option under Conditions:

A validation has been added to check if the Source Delivery is approved for client delivery.

If not approved, a toaster message will be displayed informing the user that:
"The selected Source Delivery is not approved. You cannot select this option."

The system will also automatically unselect any selected Location Based options in this case.

Please find the attached implementation document for more details.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Best regards,
[Your Name]\\\

Subject: Update on Angular Assignment Web Application Deployment

Dear [Manager’s Name],

I would like to inform you that the new Angular version of the Assignment Web Application has been deployed to the test environment.

Currently, users are able to:

Expand individual rows

Use the “Expand All” and “Collapse All” features (these are functional at the current page level only)

However, there are still a few bugs and pending items that need to be addressed:

Fixing issues at the filter level, “Expand All / Collapse All” functionality across multiple rows, and related CSS adjustments.

Completing the assigning functionality at both store level and FSR level.

Implementing the export grid functionality.

Enabling email work order generation.

I will continue working on these items and keep you updated on the progress.

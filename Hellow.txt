I wanted to share the updates and improvements I have recently worked on:

Collector Notes in Cost Report:

Added a footer message when the collector is not in the top 5 most cost-effective list, indicating:
"Collector is not in the top 5 most cost-effective list."
If the collector is terminated, a message is displayed:
"The collector who collected this store was terminated."
Tooltip Addition:

Implemented tooltips to provide more clarity and additional context where required.
Blank Screen Issue:

Resolved the blank screen issue that occurred when redirecting to the cost report page.
Future Week Selection Restriction:

Removed future weeks from the dropdown, ensuring users cannot select them.
Updated the filter to automatically select the previous week on the initial load, fetching data for that period.
Please let me know if you need further details or have any feedback on these updates.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

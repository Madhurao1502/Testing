Eralogram Toggle (DET Delivery Type)

Added a new toggle for Eralogram functionality.

This toggle will be visible only for DET delivery type.

Access restricted: it will be available only to users who are part of the techgroup.

Configuration Section – Save Functionality Update

Enhanced the save process when a user enters a Delivery Task Number that already exists.

Upon clicking Save, the system now calls the stored procedure Validated.

If matching entries are found, a popup is displayed with the list of deliveries associated with that Delivery Task Number.

User options:

Continue → The configuration section will be saved.

Cancel → The operation will be aborted, and no changes will be saved.

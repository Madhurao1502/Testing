Subject: Update on Redirection and AQ Dashboard Deliveries

Hi [Manager/Team],

The recent redirection issue was caused by an unexpected modification to the URL during the production deployment. This has now been corrected, and the redirection is working as intended, pointing to the correct web application.

On the AQ dashboard, deliveries are displayed where:

Delivery type = DET-Shelf

Signoff ∈ (2, 3) → In Collection or Collection Complete

Status ID = 8 (In Progress)

Under lan_id = foezm (Eric Harzman):

7 deliveries were found with status_id = 8 (In Progress), delivery_type = DET-Shelf, and signoff ∈ (2,3).

257 deliveries were found with status_id = 9 (Succeeded), delivery_type = DET-Shelf, and signoff ∈ (2,3), which are currently not being displayed.

Below is the query that was used to bring up this data:

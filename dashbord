Over the review period, I led the successful migration of a legacy client delivery platform from jQuery to Angular, significantly modernizing the UI/UX and aligning the codebase with current best practices. This transformation spanned critical modules such as:

Dashboards

Detail Shelf Screen

Non-Detail Shelf Screen

Key achievements include:

1. Modern UI Implementation & Enhanced User Experience
Re-architected complex form-based screens using Angular Material components like mat-form-field, mat-select, mat-card, and conditional sections, enabling a responsive and intuitive interface.

Developed dynamic form behavior with context-aware rendering (e.g., conditional fields for “Display Data Extract” vs. Shelf types), improving usability and reducing user errors.

Integrated mat-button-toggle and mat-slide-toggle controls for mode switching and feature toggles, creating a clean and streamlined workflow.

Added contextual validation and input controls ensuring a robust data entry experience.

2. Attribute & Location-Based Filtering Engine
Designed and implemented a dynamic, scalable condition view to manage both attribute-value pair selections and multi-location filters, supporting:

Real-time restoration of previous selections during edit sessions

Efficient “select all” and group reset functionalities

Smooth handling of large datasets with thousands of attribute and location entries

Architected a clean JSON payload generation mechanism that consolidates user selections into structured data ready for backend consumption, ensuring reliable data transmission and API compatibility.

Ensured complete backward compatibility with existing workflows while enhancing forward scalability.

3. Performance, Reusability, and API Integration
Refactored and modularized UI components for reusability across similar delivery types (e.g., Shelf and Extract views), reducing code duplication and improving maintainability.

Ensured seamless integration with APIs, enabling real-time data fetch, update, and persistence with robust error handling and user feedback mechanisms.

Optimized state handling to preserve user interactions across navigation or session states.

4. Business Impact
This Angular migration and interface redesign significantly improved performance, reliability, and user satisfaction.

The enhanced maintainability and modularity reduce future development effort and onboarding time for new developers.

Enabled smoother data collection and validation workflows, directly improving the quality of deliverables and client turnaround time.

Closing Note
I take pride in delivering robust, user-friendly, and scalable Angular solutions while maintaining close alignment with business goals and user needs. This project exemplifies my ability to own end-to-end delivery – from architecture to deployment – and continuously enhance systems that drive real-world value.
==========================================================

, I’ve attached screenshots of the existing jQuery-based interface for managing shelf variables. Currently, the layout uses separate tabs for Location, Section, Shelf, and UPC, each displaying their respective tree structures in isolation.

To align with the client’s latest request, we propose transforming this into a family tree-style layout, where the hierarchy is displayed as a single connected structure — visually flowing from In-Store Location down to UPC.

🔄 Proposed Change:
Instead of navigating across tabs, the entire variable structure will be shown together, like this (example flow):

css
Copy
Edit
In-Store Location
 └── Numbered Aisle
      └── Side
           ├── Left   → [Inline Tabs: Section | Shelf | UPC]
           └── Right  → [Inline Tabs: Section | Shelf | UPC]
This structure would:

Make the hierarchical relationships more intuitive and visually traceable.

Eliminate tab-switching friction, especially when viewing related levels (e.g., Left → Section → Shelf).

Allow contextual editing of Section/Shelf/UPC under each aisle side in a compact, scrollable view.

This approach better reflects how shelf arrangements are structured in real retail environments and should improve usability.


Subject: Requesting UX Design Input for Shelf Variable Layout Restructure

Hi [UX Designer's Name],

Hope you're doing well.

I’m reaching out regarding a UI change requested by the client for the shelf variable management screen. Currently, we’re using a tabbed layout with four separate sections: Location, Section, Shelf, and UPC — each with its own tree structure (attached screenshots for reference).

Client’s Request:
They want to restructure this into a "family tree-style layout" — where everything is displayed as a single, connected visual hierarchy rather than using tabs.

From what we understood, the new layout should look something like this:

In-Store Location
 └── Numbered Aisle
      └── Side
           ├── Left   → Inline: Section | Shelf | UPC
           └── Right  → Inline: Section | Shelf | UPC
We’d really appreciate your guidance on:

How this family-tree flow could be designed from a UX perspective

If you'd recommend any best practices or examples for such visual structures

How we can present nested levels (like Section/Shelf/UPC) inline without overwhelming the user

Let me know if you'd like a walkthrough or sample prototype. I can also assist in refining the UI structure if needed.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
